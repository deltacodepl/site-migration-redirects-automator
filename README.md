# Site Migration Redirects Automator v.1

## 👉🏼 Description
This Streamlit tool was developed to automate the process of redirect mapping during website migrations, facilitating the matching of URLs from an old to a new site based on content similarity. Using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques provided by the `sentence-transformers` library and efficient search algorithms provided by `faiss`, the tool is able to process and compare large datasets, identifying the most relevant matches between the pages of the original site and those of the target site.

## 👉🏼 Features
- Upload CSV files for source and destination URLs
- Automatically calculate content similarity between URLs
- Display recommended redirect mappings with similarity scores

## 👉🏼 How to Use
1. Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Start the application with Streamlit using the command `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.
3. Upload the source and destination CSV files through the user interface.
4. Click on "Run Matching" to generate the redirect mappings.

## 👉🏼 Technologies Used
- `faiss-cpu`: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- `sentence-transformers`: A Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text, and image embeddings.
- `pandas`: An open-source data manipulation and analysis library.
- `ipywidgets`: An interactive widget library for Jupyter notebooks.

## 👉🏼 Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Credits
    
This tool is based on the original Python script [Automated Redirect Matchmaker for Site Migrations](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Y4msGtQf44IRzCotz8KMy0oawwZ2yIbT?usp=sharing) developed by [Daniel Emery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpe1/), which provides an automated approach to mapping redirects during website migrations. The tool has been extended and integrated into a Streamlit application to improve interactivity and usability.
